# GARDENING APP

**Created by Zali Rae** 2025
This is a terminal based application where you create and maintain a garden, with a selection of different plants! You can water, fertilize, plant seeds and ultimately even save your garden to a json file. 

This app is a text based, simple and interactive game, where the user has a certain level of control over the garden - promoting imagination of what that space would look like. It was really enjoyable to imagine and construct the different functions, figuring out how they all worked and became interactive. I used a virtual environment to install necessary packages and libraries: *Colorama* (to colourise and diversify text) and *Questionary* (for nice looking command line interfaces, in this case using the arrow keys navigate up and down and select which action you would like to take). 

## SET UP and HELP

This app runs on Python3! As well as uses a couple of libraries you will have to install to help everything run smoothly and to get the most out of the game. 
Here is some documentation on installing Python3 if you haven't already got it:

[Installing Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

As well as some documentation on used libraries, Colorama & Questionary:

[COLORAMA install & documentation](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
[QUESTIONARY install & documentation](https://pypi.org/project/questionary/)

And now, some instructions on setting up your Gardening App on your own device...

If it is not installed, you will need to install it to continue. 

Next you will install the necessary libraries:

Once those have successfully installed, you can run the app: 
*for python versions below 3.13 run:*
-> python gardening_app.py
